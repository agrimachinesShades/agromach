            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Agricultural Engineering Machines and Agricultural Mechanisation deals with manufacture,distribution and the operation of all type of tools, implements, and machines for agricultural development.
            Equipment used on the farm may be divided into two main categories, that is, farm power and farm 
             machinery. Farm machinery generally covers those tools, implements and machines used on the 
             farm. A machine may be as simple as a wedge or as complex as a combine harvester. The term, 
             however, normally refers to tractors and other engine- powered equipment.
             Agricultural mechanisation employs a combination of three main sources of power: human, animal 
             and mechanical/engine. This gives rise to three broad levels of agricultural mechanisation 
             technology classified as hand-tool technology (HTT), draught-animal technology (DAT) and 
             mechanical-power or engine-power technology (EPT). Other sources of power may include 
             electricity and various forms of renewable energy sources such as solar energy, biogas, biomass 
             and wind energy.
